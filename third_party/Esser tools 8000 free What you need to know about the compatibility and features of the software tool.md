# Tacx Trainer Software 4: A Guide for Beginners
 
Tacx Trainer Software 4 (TTS4) is a software application that allows you to use your Tacx trainer with your computer. You can enjoy realistic videos, virtual reality worlds, GPS rides, online multiplayer and more. However, TTS4 is no longer supported by Tacx since 2019, and you cannot activate or deactivate your license anymore.

In this article, we will explain how to download, install, backup and use TTS4 on your computer.

## How to install TTS4
 
To install TTS4 on your computer, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Change the name of your computer to match the name of the computer on which the license was activated. You can find this name in your license file (tts4.lic or tts4b.lic).
2. Install the TTS 4.23 software and 4.23.1 patch.
3. Delete the two new license files (tts4.lic and tts4b.lic) created by TTS4, located in C:\ProgramData\Tacx\TrainerSoftware\TTS4\.
4. Copy your pre-activated license files into the same folder.

## How to backup TTS4
 
To backup TTS4 on your computer, you need to copy the following folders:

- The 'TacxTrainerSoftware4' folder ( C:\Program Files (x86)\Tacx\)
- The 'Common' folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\Tacx\)
- The 'TTS4' folder (C:\ProgramData\Tacx\TrainerSoftware\)
