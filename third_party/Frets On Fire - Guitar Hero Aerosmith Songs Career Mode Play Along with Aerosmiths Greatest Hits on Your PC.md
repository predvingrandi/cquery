## Step 1: Download the Guitar Hero Aerosmith mod
 
The Guitar Hero Aerosmith mod is a fan-made project that contains all the songs from the Guitar Hero Aerosmith game, as well as the graphics, menus, and sound effects.

The mod is divided into four parts: Part 1 contains the songs from Tier 1 and 2, Part 2 contains the songs from Tier 3 and 4, Part 3 contains the songs from Tier 5 and 6, and Part 4 contains the bonus songs. You will need to download all four parts to play the full career mode.
 
## Step 2: Extract the mod files
 
Once you have downloaded all four parts of the mod, you will need to extract them using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip.

You should overwrite any existing files if prompted.
