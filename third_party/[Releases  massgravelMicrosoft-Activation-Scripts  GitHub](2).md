## Download and Extract the Script
 
There are two methods to download and extract the script:
 
1. Method 1 - PowerShell (Recommended): On Windows 8.1/10/11, right-click on the windows start menu and select PowerShell or Terminal (Not CMD). Copy-paste the below code and press enter:
`irm https://massgrave.dev/get | iex`
This will download and run the script automatically.
2. Method 2 - Traditional: Download the file from [here](https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts/releases). Right-click on the downloaded zip file and extract it. In the extracted folder, find the folder named All-In-One-Version. Run the file named MAS\_AIO.cmd.

## Select the Activation Option
 
After running the script, you will see a menu with four activation options:

- HWID: This option will activate Windows permanently by generating a digital license based on your hardware ID. It works for all editions of Windows 10/11 except LTSB/LTSC.
- KMS38: This option will activate Windows until 2038 by creating a local KMS server on your system. It works for all editions of Windows 10/11 including LTSB/LTSC.
- Online KMS: This option will activate Windows and Office for 180 days by connecting to an online KMS server. It works for all editions of Windows 8.1/10/11 and Office 2010-2022. You need to renew the activation every 180 days by running the script again.
- Digital License Switcher: This option will switch your existing KMS38 or Online KMS activation to HWID activation.

Select the option that suits your needs and follow the onscreen instructions. The script will perform the activation process and show you the result.
 
## Verify the Activation Status
 
To verify that your Windows and Office products are activated, you can use the following methods:

- For Windows: Go to Settings > Update & Security > Activation and check the activation status.
- For Office: Open any Office application and go to File > Account and check the activation status.

You can also use the Check Activation Status option in the script menu to see the details of your activation.
